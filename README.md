# finger-counter-opencv-python
I built a real-time hand-tracking and finger-counting system using OpenCV, NumPy, and classical computer-vision techniques. The project detects skin in the YCrCb color space, extracts the hand contour, computes convexity defects, and estimates the number of raised fingers — all in real time using a webcam.
